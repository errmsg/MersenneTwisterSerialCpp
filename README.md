# MersenneTwisterSerialCpp

Classic Mersenne twister algorithm for pseudorandom number generator (PRNG). It is serial, meaning that no parallelization is involved.
It is based on the code written by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto. Code is initially writing in C and ported to C++ (by me). Algorithm is 64 bit. See "mt_serial_h" for more.
